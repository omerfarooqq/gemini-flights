# Gemini Flight Manager

## Overview

Gemini Flight Manager is a comprehensive backend system built using FastAPI, designed for managing and simulating flight-related operations. This system provides a robust platform for handling various aspects of flight management, including flight generation, search, and booking functionalities.

The project leverages FastAPI's efficient and easy-to-use framework to create a high-performance, scalable solution ideal for flight data management. It comes equipped with an SQLite database (`flights.db`) pre-populated with initial data, allowing for quick deployment and testing.

Key features of Gemini Flight Manager include:
- Advanced search capabilities to query flights based on criteria like origin, destination, and dates.
- Booking system that handles seat availability across different classes and calculates costs accordingly.

Designed with extensibility and scalability in mind, Gemini Flight Manager is well-suited for both educational purposes and as a foundation for more complex flight management applications.
